            I like to travel. I am a travel freak. I have visited many place.
             whenever i get free time i try to explore any place it would be far or near. 
             Because i get fresh whenever I go to in greeny place and it gives me pleasure. 
             Today i want to share about a place where i have visited recently with my varsity friend. 
            The place name is Panam City or Panam Nagor. it is an ancient city. It is situated at Sonargaon, Narayanganj in Bangladesh.
            It is one of the earliest cities in Bangladesh that is still standing. 
             Among the three cities of the time period: Boro nagar, Khas Nagar 
            and Panam Nagar; Panam Nagar was the most attractive one.
            I have visited this city in my semester break with my friend. i saw many old building.
            The buildings design is amazing and there is a feel of ancient castle. 
            we had lunch a restruant near to the city. over all we enjoyed a lot.
